<h1>KISS-C Programmers Manual for the CBC Botball Controller</h1>
<br/>

<!--Introduction-->

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>KIPR's Instructional Software System-C (KISS-C for short) is a development environment for the C language consisting of an editor, a
compiler and a set of libraries and simulator for the CBC Botball Controller.
KISS-C implements the full ANSI C specification. For information about the C programing language, including history and basic syntax, see the 
Wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C (programming language)</a>.  
For a more complete tutorial and guide for C Programming visit <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/" target="_blank">CPrograming</a>. The 
<a href="http://community.botball.org" target="_blank">Botball community website</a> 
also has several articles about programming and a user forum where questions can be posted to the botball community.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this manual is to describe the CBC Botball Controller libraries and simulator, which are extensions to the C programming 
language. This file also provides a basic introduction to programming in C. To learn more about programming in C, consult one
of the many books or websites that provide C references and tutorials. </p>

<!--KISS-C Interface-->

<a name="KISS-C_Interface"></a>
<h2>KISS-C Interface</h2> 

<p>Both new (unsaved) and saved files can be opened for editing in KISS-C. A row 
of tabs lists the files that have been opened. Clicking a file's tab activates 
it for editing.</p>

<p>The File menu has standard entries for New, Open, Save, Save As, Print, Close
and Exit.</p>

<p>To simulate the active file, simply click the Simulate button. The active file 
will also be saved, unless it is new, in which case the user is prompted for 
a &quot;save as&quot; file name. The active file must contain or #include the 
main function, in order to be simulated.</p>

<p>To download the active file, click on the Download button. If the serial port connecting 
the CBC to your pc has not already been specified, a dialog will appear to set 
it.</p>

<p>The interface provides additional capabilities for program entry/edit, minor 
adjustment to the display (font size), auto-completion and auto-indentation. If there is a syntax 
error in the program, an error window will appear at the bottom of the KISS 
C screen with the error message and the file and line number where the error 
was detected. If the error occurred in the active file, then clicking on the 
error message will move to that line. The edit menu provides a Go to line option.</p>

<p>C programs are automatically formatted and indented. Keywords, comments, and 
text strings are highlighted with color unless this feature is turned off. 
Most CBC-specific library functions will have pop-help when they are entered 
into the input window.</p>

<p>KISS-C does parenthesis-balance-highlighting when the cursor is placed to the 
right of any right parenthesis, bracket, or brace.</p>

<!--A_Quick_C_Tutorial-->

<a name="A_Quick_C_Tutorial"></a>
<h2>A Quick C Tutorial</h2>

<p>Most C programs consist of function definitions and data structures.
Here is a simple C program that defines a single function, called <b>main</b>.</p>

<pre><code><font class="Comment">/* Simple example: C Programmer's Manual */</font>

<font class="CVariable">int</font> main()
{
    <font class="CFunction">printf</font>(<font class="Quote">&quot;Hello, world!/n&quot;</font>);<font class="Comment">// simple example</font>
}
</code></pre><br/>

<p>The Expression <br/><br/>
/* &lt;text&gt; */<br/><br/>
forms a multi-line or bracketed comment. In contrast, text that 
starts with <br/><br/>//<br/><br/> forms a single line comment, 
which continues only to the end of the line. Comments are ignored by KISS-C when the 
program is compiled.  </p>

<p>All functions must have a return type. While main 
does not return a value to another function, it does return an integer to the 
operating system, and so is of type <font class="CVariable">int</font>. 
Other types include no return value (<font class="CVariable">void</font>) and 
floating point numbers (<font class="CVariable">float</font>). 
This function declaration information must precede each function definition. </p>

<p>Immediately following the function declaration is the function's
name (in this case,<b>main</b>). Next, in parentheses, are any arguments
(or inputs) to the function. <b>main</b> has none, but an empty set of
parentheses is still required. </p>

<p>After the function arguments is an open curly-brace {. This signifies the start of the
actual function code. Curly-braces signify program blocks, or chunks of code. </p>

<p>Next comes a series of C statements. Statements demand that some action be taken.
Our demonstration program has a single statement, a <font class="CFunction">printf</font>
("Hello, world!/n"). This will print the message <b>"Hello, world!"</b> to the LCD display. The <b>\n</b>
indicates end-of-line. The <font class="CFunction">printf</font> statement ends
with a semicolon (;). All C statements must be ended by a semicolon. Beginning C 
programmers commonly make the error of omitting the semicolon that is required to end each statement. </p>

<p>The <b>main</b> function is ended by the close curly-brace }.</p>

<p>Let's look at another example to learn some more features of C.
The following code
defines the function square, which returns the mathematical
square of a number.</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">int</font> square(<font class="CVariable">int</font> n)
{
    <font class="CVariable">return</font>(n * n);
}</code></pre><br/>

<p>The function is declared as type <font class="CVariable">int</font>,
which means that it will return an integer value.</p>

<p>Next comes the function named <b>square</b>, followed by its
argument list in parentheses.
    Square has one argument, <b>n</b>, which is an integer. Notice how
declaring the type of the
argument is done similarly to declaring the type of the function.</p>

<p>When a function has arguments declared, those argument variables are
valid within the
"scope" of the function (i.e., they only have meaning within the
function's own code).
Other functions may use the same variable names independently.</p>

<p>The code, or &quot;scope&quot;, for <b>square</b> is
contained within the set of curly braces. In fact, it consists of a
single statement: the <font class="CVariable">return</font>
statement. The
<font class="CVariable">return</font> statement exits the
function and
returns the value of the C expression that follows it (in this
case "<b>n * n</b>").</p>

<p>Except where grouped by parentheses, expressions are evaluated
according to a set of
precedence rules associated with the various operations within the
expression. In this
case, there is only one operation (multiplication), signified by the "<b>*</b>",
so precedence is
not an issue.</p>

<p>Let's look at an example of a function that performs a function call
to the square program.</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">float</font> hypotenuse(<font class="CVariable">int</font> a, <font class="CVariable">int</font> b)
{
    <font class="CVariable">float</font> h;
    h = <font class="CFunction">sqrt</font>((<font class="CVariable">float</font>)(square(a) + square(b)));
    <font class="CVariable">return</font>(h);
}</code></pre><br/>

<p>This code demonstrates several more features of C. First, notice that
the floating point
variable <b>h</b> is defined at the beginning of the <b>hypotenuse</b>
function. In general, whenever
a new program block (indicated by a set of curly braces) is begun, new
local variables
may be defined.</p>

<p>The value of <b>h</b> is set to the result of a call to the <font class="CFunction">sqrt</font>
function. It turns out that <font class="Cfunction">sqrt</font> is a
built-in KISS-C function that takes a floating point number as its
argument.</p>

<p>We want to use the <font class="CFunction">square</font> function we defined earlier, which
returns its result as an
integer. But the sqrt function requires a floating point argument. We
get around this
type incompatibility by coercing the integer sum (<font class="CFunction">square</font>(a) +
<font class="CFunction">square</font>(b)) into a
float by preceding it with the desired type, in parentheses. Thus, the
integer sum is
made into a floating point number and passed along to <font class="CFunction">sqrt</font>.</p>

<p>The <b>hypotenuse</b> function finishes by returning the value of <b>h</b>. </p>

<p>Note that the functions square and hypotenuse are functions, not a program. 
If they are in the same file as the main function written above, they will never 
be called. If main was modified to be:</p>

<pre><code><font class="Comment">/* Simple example: C Programmer's Manual */</font>

<font class="CVariable">int</font> main()
{
    <font class="CFunction">printf</font>(<font class="Quote">"Hypotenuse of 3,4 is %d\n"</font>,hypotenuse(3,4)); <font class="Comment">// call a function</font>
}</code></pre><br/>

<p>then the program (which always starts execution with <strong>main</strong>) 
would calculate and print out the hypotenuse of a triangle with side lengths 
of 3 &amp; 4. However, <strong>C</strong> requires that functions bedefined 
before they are first called. Since hypotenuse is called in main, either the 
functions need to be defined earlier in the file, or they can be prototyped 
at the begining of the file. A <em>prototype</em> of a <strong>C</strong> function 
is simply a <strong>C</strong> statement that includes the return type, function 
name and types of the parameters. For example the prototypes of the functions 
<strong>square</strong> and <strong>hypotenuse</strong> would be:</p>
  
<pre><code><font class="CVariable">int</font> square(<font class="CVariable">int</font> n);
<font class="CVariable">float</font> hypotenuse(<font class="CVariable">int</font> a, <font class="CVariable">int</font> b);</code></pre><br/>

<p>The order in which function protypes appear does not matter as long as they 
come before the definitions that call that function.</p>

<p>This concludes the brief C tutorial. </p>

<!--Data_Objects-->

<a name="Data_Objects"></a>
<h2>Data Objects</h2>

<p>Variables and constants are the basic data objects in a C program.
Declarations list the
variables to be used, state what type they are, and may set their
initial value.</p>

<!--Variables-->

<a name="Variables"></a>
<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>Variable names are case-sensitive. The underscore character is
allowed and is often used
to enhance the readability of long variable names. C keywords like <font class="CVariable">if</font>,
<font class="CVariable">while</font>, etc. may
not be used as variable names.</p>

<p>Functions and global variables may not have the same name. In
addition, if a local
variable is named the same as a function or a global variable, the
local use takes
precedence; ie., use of the function or global variable is prevented
within the scope of the
local variable.</p>

<!--Declaration-->

<a name="Declaration"></a>
<div class="Indent">

<h4>Declaration</h4>

<p>In C, variables can be declared at the top level (outside of any
curly braces) or at the start
of each block (a functional unit of code surrounded by curly braces).
In general, a variable declaration is of the form:</p>

<div class="indent">
<table>
    <tr>
    <td>&lt;type&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;variable-name&gt;; or </font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>&lt;type&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;variable-name&gt;=&lt;initialization-data&gt;;</font></td>
    </tr>
</table> <br/>
</div>

In KISS-C, &lt;<a href="KISSCBCManualBody.htm#Data_Types" target="ManualFrame">type</a>&gt; can be 
<font class="CVariable">int</font>, <font class="CVariable">float</font>,
<font class="CVariable">char</font>, or <font class="CVariable">struct</font>
&lt;struct-name&gt;,
and determines the primary type of the variable declared. This form
changes somewhat when
dealing with pointer and array declarations, which are explained in a
later section, but in
general this is the way you declare variables.

<!--Local_and_Global_Scopes-->

<a name="Local_and_Global_Scopes"></a>
<h4>Local and Global Scopes</h4>
   
<p>If a variable is declared within a function, or as an argument
to a function, its binding is
local, meaning that the variable has existence only within
that function definition.
If a variable is declared outside of a function, it is a global
variable. It is defined for all
functions, including functions which are defined in files other than
the one in which the
global variable was declared.</p>

<!--Variable_Initialization-->

<a name="Variable_Initialization"></a>
<h4>Variable Initialization</h4>
    
<p>Local and global variables can be initialized to a value when
they are declared. If no
initialization value is given, their value is indeterminate.</p>

<p>All global variable declarations must be initialized to constant
values. Local variables
may be initialized to the value of arbitrary expressions including any
global variables,
function calls, function arguments, or local variables which have
already been initialized.</p>
    
<p>Here is a small example of how initialized declarations are
used.</p>
    
<pre><code><font class="CVariable">int</font> i=50; <font class="Comment">/* declare i as global integer; initial value 50 */</font>
<font class="CVariable">float</font> j=100.123; <font class="Comment">/* declare j as global float; initial value 100.123 */</font>
<font class="CVariable">int</font> foo()
{
    <font class="CVariable">int</font> x; <font class="Comment">/* declare x as local integer; initial value 0 */</font>
    <font class="CVariable">float</font> y=j; <font class="Comment">/* declare y as local float; initial value j */</font>
}</code></pre><br/>

<p>Local variables are initialized whenever the function containing them
is executed.
Global variables are initialized whenever a reset condition occurs.
Reset conditions occur
when:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Code is downloaded;</li>
    <li>The <b>main()</b> procedure is run;</li>
    <li>System hardware reset occurs</li>
</ol>
</div>

<!--Constants-->

<a name="Constants"></a>
<h3>Constants</h3>

<div class="indent">
<a name="Integer_Constants"></a>
<h4>Integer Constants</h4>
    
<p>Integers constants may be defined in decimal integer format
(e.g., <b>4053</b> or <b>-1</b>) or
hexadecimal format using the "<b>0x</b>" prefix (e.g., <b>0x1fffffff</b>).</p>

<!--Floating_Point_Constants-->

<a name="Floating_Point_Constants"></a>
<h4>Floating Point</font> constants</h4>

<p>Floating point numbers may use exponential notation (e.g., "<b>10e3</b>"
or "<b>10E3</b>") or may
contain a decimal period. For example, the floating point zero can be
given as "<b>0.</b>",
"<b>0.0</b>", or "<b>0E1</b>", but not as just "<b>0</b>". Since
the board has no floating point hardware,
floating point operations are much slower than integer operations, and
should be used
sparingly.</p>

<!--Characters_and_String_Constants-->

<a name="Characters_and_String_Constants"></a>
<h4>Characters and String Constants</h4>

<p>Quoted characters return their ASCII value (e.g., '<b>x</b>').</p>

<p>Character string constants are defined with quotation marks,
e.g.,
<font class="Quote">"This is a character string."</font>.</p>

<!--NULL-->

<a name="NULL"></a>
<h4>NULL</h4>
    
<p>The special constant <b>NULL</b> has the value of zero and can
be assigned to and compared to
pointer or array variables (which will be described in later sections).
In general, you
cannot convert other constants to be of a pointer type, so there are
many times when
<b>NULL</b> can be useful.</p>

<p>For example, in order to check if a pointer has been initialized
you could compare its
value to <b>NULL</b> and not try to access its contents if it was <b>NULL</b>.
Also, if you had a defined
a linked list type consisting of a value and a pointer to the next
element, you could look
for the end of the list by comparing the next pointer to <b>NULL</b>.</p>
</div>

<!--Data_Types-->

<a name="Data_Types"></a>
<h3>Data Types</h3>

<p>KISS-C supports the following data types:</p>

<!--32-bit_Integers-->

<div class="indent">

<a name="32-bit_Integers"></a>
<h4>32-bit Integers</h4>

<p>32-bit integers are signified by the type indicator 
<font class="CVariable">int</font>. They are signed integers, and
may be valued from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647 decimal.</p>

<!--32-bit_Floating_Point_Numbers-->

<a name="32-bit_Floating_Point_Numbers"></a>
<h4>32-bit Floating Point Numbers</h4>

<p>Floating point numbers are signified by the type indicator 
<font class="CVariable">float</font>. They have
approximately seven decimal digits of precision and are valued from
about 10^-38 to
10^38.</p>

<!--8-bit_Characters-->

<a name="8-bit_Characters"></a>
<h4>8-bit Characters</h4>

<p>Characters are an 8-bit number signified by the type indicator 
<font class="CVariable">char</font>. A character's value
typically represents a printable symbol using the standard ASCII
character code, but this
is not necessary; characters can be used to refer to arbitrary 8-bit
numbers.</p>

<!--Pointers-->

<a name="Pointers"></a>
<h4>Pointers</h4>

<p>KISS-C pointers are 32-bit numbers which represent locations in memory.
Values in memory
can be manipulated by calculating, passing and dereferencing
pointers representing the
location where the information is stored.</p>

<a name="Arrays1"></a>
<h4>Arrays</h4>

<p>Arrays are used to store homogenous lists of data (meaning that all the
elements of an
array have the same type). Every array has a length which is determined
at the time the
array is declared. The data stored in the elements of an array can be
set and retrieved in
the same manner as for other variables.</p>

<a name="Structures1"></a>
<h4>Structures</h4>

<p>Structures are used to store non-homogenous but related sets of
data. Elements of a
structure are referenced by name instead of number and may be of any
supported type.</p>

<p>Structures are useful for organizing related data into a
coherent format, reducing the
number of arguments passed to functions, increasing the effective
number of values
which can be returned by functions, and creating complex data
representations such as
directed graphs and linked lists.</p>

</div>

<!--Pointers-->

<a name="PointersM"></a>
<h3>Pointers</h3>

<p>The address where a value is stored in memory is known as the
pointer to that value. It is
often useful to deal with pointers to objects, but great care must be
taken to insure that the
pointers used at any point in your code really do point to valid
objects in memory.</p>

<p>For additional information on programming with C pointers, please refer to a C programming book or website.</p>

<!--Arrays-->

<a name="Arrays"></a>
<h3>Arrays</h3>

<p>KISS-C supports arrays of characters, integers,
floating-point numbers,
structures, pointers, and array pointers (multi-dimensional arrays).
The main reasons
that arrays are useful are that they allow you to allocate space for
many instances of a
given type, send an arbitrary number of values to functions, and
provide the means for
iterating over a set of values.</p>

<!--Declaring_and_Initializing_Arrays-->

<a name="Declaring_and_Initializing_Arrays"></a>
<div class="Indent">
<h4>Declaring and Initializing Arrays</h4>

<p>Arrays are declared using square brackets. The following statement
declares an array of
ten integers:</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">int</font> foo[10];
</code></pre><br/>

<p> this array, elements are numbered from 0 to 9. Elements are accessed
by enclosing the
index number within square brackets: <b>foo[4]</b> denotes the fifth
element of the array foo
(since counting begins at zero).</p>

<p>Arrays not initialized at declaration contain indeterminate values. Arrays
may be initialized
at declaration by specifying the array elements, separated by commas,
within curly
braces. If no size value is specified within the square brackets when
the array is declared
but initialization information is given, the size of the array is
determined by the number
of elements given in the declaration. For example,</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">int</font> foo[]= {0, 4, 5, -8,  17, 301};
</code></pre></br>

<p>creates an array of six integers, with <b>foo[0]</b> equaling <b>0</b>,
<b>foo[1]</b> equaling <b>4</b>, etc.</p>

<p>If a size is specified and initialization data is given, the length
of the initialization data
may not exceed the specified length of the array or an error results.
If, on the other hand,
you specify the size and provide fewer initialization elements than the
total length of the
array, the remaining elements contain indeterminate values.</p>

<p>Character arrays are typically text strings. There is a special
syntax for initializing arrays
of characters. The character values of the array are enclosed in
quotation marks:</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">char</font> string[]= <font class="Quote">"Hello there"</font>;
</code></pre><br/>

<p>This form creates a character array called <b>string</b> with the
ASCII values of the specified
characters. In addition, the character array is terminated by a zero.
Because of this zero-termination, the character array can be treated as
a string for purposes of printing (for
example). Character arrays can be initialized using the curly braces
syntax, but they will
not be automatically null-terminated in that case. In general, printing
of character arrays
that are not null-terminated will cause problems.</p>

<!--Passing_Arrays_as_Arguments-->

<a name="Passing_Arrays_as_Arguments"></a>
<h4>Passing Arrays as Arguments</h4>

<p>When an array is passed to a function as an argument, the array's
pointer is actually
passed, rather than the elements of the array. If the function modifies
the array values, the
array will be modified, since there is only one copy of the array in
memory.</p>

<p>There are two ways of declaring an array argument: as
an array or as a
pointer to the type of the array's elements.</p>

<p>As an example, the following function takes an index and an array,
and returns the array
element specified by the index:</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">int</font> retrieve_element(<font class="CVariable">int</font> index, <font class="CVariable">int</font> array[])
{
    <font class="CVariable">return</font> array[index];
}</code></pre><br/>

<p>Notice the use of the square brackets to declare the argument array as
a pointer to an
array of integers.</p>

<p>When passing an array variable to a function, you are actually
passing the value of the
array pointer itself and not one of its elements, so no square brackets
are used.</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">void</font> foo()
{
    <font class="CVariable">int</font> array[10];
    retrieve_element(3, array);
}</code></pre><br/>

<!--Multi-dimensional_Arrays-->

<a name="Multi-dimensional_Arrays"></a>
<h4>Multi-dimensional Arrays</h4>

<p>A two-dimensional array is just like a single dimensional array
whose elements are one-dimensional arrays. Declaration of a two-dimensional array is as
follows:</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">int</font> k[2][3];
</code></pre><br/>

<p>The number in the first set of brackets is the number of 1-D arrays of 
<font class="CVariable">int</font>. The number in
the second set of brackets is the length of each of the 1-D arrays of 
<font class="CVariable">int</font>. In this example,
<b>k</b> is an array containing two 1-D arrays; <b>k[0]</b> is a 1-D
array of <font face="Courier" color=blue>int</font> of length 3;
<b>k[0][1]</b> is an <font face="Courier" color=blue>int</font>.
Arrays of with any number of dimensions can be generalized from
this example by adding more brackets in the declaration.</p>

</div>

<!--Structures-->

<a name="Structures"></a>
<h3>Structures</h3>

<p>Structures are used to store non-homogenous but related sets of
data. Elements of a
structure are referenced by name instead of number and may be of any
supported type.
Structures are useful for organizing related data into a coherent
format, reducing the
number of arguments passed to functions, increasing the effective
number of values
which can be returned by functions, and creating complex data
representations such as
directed graphs and linked lists.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to define a structure, declare a
variable of structure
type, and access its elements.</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">struct</font> foo
{
    <font class="CVariable">int</font> i;
    <font class="CVariable">int</font> j;
};
<font class="CVariable">struct</font> foo f1;
<font class="CVariable">void</font> set_f1(<font class="CVariable">int</font> i,<font class="CVariable">int</font> j)
{
    f1.i=i;
    f1.j=j;
}
<font class="CVariable">void</font> get_f1(<font class="CVariable">int</font> *i,<font class="CVariable">int</font> *j)
{
    *i=f1.i;
    *j=f1.j;
}</code></pre><br/>

<p>The first part is the structure definition. It consists of the keyword
<font class="CVariable">struct</font>, followed by
the name of the structure (which can be any valid identifier), followed
by a list of named
elements in curly braces. This definition specifies the structure of
the type <font class="CVariable">struct</font> <b>foo</b>.
Once there is a definition of this form, you can use the type 
<font class="CVariable">struct</font> <b>foo</b> just like any
other type. The line</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">struct</font> foo f1;
</code></pre><br/>

<p>is a global variable declaration which declares the variable <b>f1</b>
to be of type <font class="CVariable">struct</font>
<b>foo</b>.</p>

<p>The dot operator is used to access the elements of a variable of
structure type. In this
case, <b>f1.i</b> and <b>f1.j</b> refer to the two elements of <b>f1</b>.
You can treat the quantities <b>f1.i</b>
and <b>f1.j</b> just as you would treat any variables of type 
<font class="CVariable">int</font> (the type of the elements was
defined in the structure declaration at the top to be 
<font class="CVariable">int</font>).</p>
 
<p>Pointers to structure types can also be used, just like pointers to
any other type. However,
with structures, there is a special short-cut for referring to the
elements of the structure
pointed to.</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">struct</font> foo *fptr;
<font class="CVariable">void</font> main()
{
    fptr=&amp;f1;
    fptr-&gt;i=10;
    fptr-&gt;j=20;
}</code></pre><br/>

<p> this example, <b>fptr</b> is declared to be a pointer to type 
<font class="CVariable">struct</font> <b>foo</b>. In main, it is
set to point to the global <b>f1</b> defined above. Then the elements of the
structure pointed to by <b>fptr</b>
(in this case these are the same as the elements of <b>f1</b>), are
set. The arrow operator is used
instead of the dot operator because fptr is a pointer to a variable of
type <font class="CVariable">struct</font> <b>foo</b>. Note
that <b>(*fptr).i</b> would have worked just as well as 
<b>fptr-&gt;</font>i</b>, but it would have been
clumsier.</p>

<p>Note that only pointers to structures, not the structures
themselves, can be passed to or
returned from functions.</p>

<!--Complex_Initialization_examples-->

<a name="Complex_Initialization_examples"></a>
<h3>Complex Initialization examples</h3>

<p>Complex types -- arrays and structures -- may be initialized upon
declaration with a
sequence of constant values contained within curly braces and separated
by commas.</p>

<p>Arrays of character may also be initialized with a quoted string of
characters.</p>

<p>For initialized declarations of single dimensional arrays, the
length can be left blank and
a suitable length based on the initialization data will be assigned to
it. Multi-dimensional
arrays must have the size of all dimensions specified when the array is
declared. If a
length is specified, the initialization data may not overflow that
length in any dimension
or an error will result. However, the initialization data may be
shorter than the specified
size and the remaining entries will be initialized to 0.</p>

<p>Following is an example of legal global and local variable
initializations:</p>

<!--Statements_and_Expressions-->

<h2>Statements and Expressions</h2>

<p>Operators act upon objects of a certain type or types and specify
what is to be done to
them. Expressions combine variables and constants to create new values.
Statements are
expressions, assignments, function calls, or control flow statements
which make up C
programs.</p>

<!--Operators-->

<a name="Operators"></a>
<h3>Operators</h3>

<p>Each of the data types has its own set of operators that determine
which operations may
be performed on them.</p>

<!--Integer_Operations-->

<a name="Integer_Operations"></a>
<div class="indent">
<h4>Integer Operations</h4>

<p>The following operations are supported on integers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Arithmetic</b>. addition +</font>,
subtraction -</font>, multiplication <font
 face="Courier">*</font>, division /</font>. </li>
  <li><b>Comparison</b>. greater-than &gt;</font>,
less-than &lt;</font>, equality <font
 face="Courier">==</font>, greater-than-equal &gt;=</font>,
less-than-equal &lt;=</font>. </li>
  <li><b>Bitwise Arithmetic</b>. bitwise-OR |</font>,
bitwise-AND &amp;</font>, bitwise-exclusive-OR <font
 face="Courier">^</font>, bitwise-NOT ~</font>. </li>
  <li><b>Boolean Arithmetic</b>. logical-OR ||</font>,
logical-AND &amp;&amp;</font>, logical-NOT <font
 face="Courier">!</font>. <br/>
When a C statement uses a boolean value (for example, <font
 face="Courier" class="CVariable">if</font>), it takes the integer zero as
meaning false, and any integer other than zero as meaning true. The
boolean operators return zero for false and one for true. Boolean
operators &amp;&amp;</font> and <font
 face="Courier">||</font> will stop executing as soon as the truth of
the final expression is determined. For example, in the expression <font
 face="Courier">a &amp;&amp; b</font>, if a</font>
is false, then b</font> does not need to be
evaluated because the result must be false. The &amp;&amp;</font>
operator therefore will not evaluate b</font>.</li>
</ul>

<!--Floating_Point_Numbers-->

<a name="Floating_Point_Numbers"></a>
<h4>Floating Point Numbers</h4>

<p>KISS-C uses a package of floatingpoint routines. This
package includes arithmetic, trigonometric, and logarithmic functions.
Since floating
point operations are implemented in software, they are much slower than
the integer
operations; we recommend against using floating point if you are
concerned about
performance.</p>

<p>The following operations are supported on floating point numbers:</p>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Arithmetic</b>. addition +</font>,

        <li><b>Comparison</b>. greater-than &gt;</font>,
less-than &lt;</font>, equality <font
 face="Courier">==</font>, greater-than-equal &gt;=</font>,
less-than-equal &lt;=</font>.
        </li>
        <li><b>Built-in Math Functions</b>. A set of trigonometric,
logarithmic, and exponential
functions is supported. For details, go to the
          <a href="#Library%20Function%20Descriptions">Library Function
Descriptions</a>.
These functions are included among those itemized as "Math" functions.</li>

<!--Characters-->

<a name="Characters"></a>
<h4>Characters</h4>

<p>Characters are only allowed in character arrays. When a cell of the
array is referenced, it
is automatically coerced into a integer representation for manipulation
by the integer
operations. When a value is stored into a character array, it is
coerced from a standard 16-
bit integer into an 8-bit character (by truncating the upper eight
bits).</p>

</div>

<!--Assignment_Operators_and_Expressions-->

<a name="Assignment_Operators_and_Expressions"></a>
<h2>Assignment Operators and Expressions</h2>

<p>The basic assignment operator is =</font>. The
following statement adds 2 to the value of a</font>.</p>

<pre><code>a = a + 2;</code></pre><br/>

<p>The abbreviated form</p>

<pre><code>a += 2;</code></pre><br/>

<p>could also be used to perform the same operation.
All of the following binary operators can be used in this fashion:</p>

<pre><code>+   -   *   /   %   &lt;&lt;   &gt;&gt;   &amp;   ^   |</code></pre><br/>

<!--Increment_and_Decrement_Operators-->

<a name="Increment_and_Decrement_Operators"></a>
<h2>Increment and Decrement Operators</h2>

<p>The increment operator "++</font>" increments
the named variable. For example, the
construction "a++</font>" is equivalent to "
a= a+1</font>" or "a+= 1</font>".
A statement that uses an increment operator has a value. For example,
the statement</p>

<pre><code>a = 3; <font class="CFunction">printf</font>(<font class="Quote">"a=%d a+1=%d\n"</font>, a, ++a);
</code></pre><br/>

<p>will display the text "a=3 a+1=4</font>".
If the increment operator comes after the named variable, then the
value of the statement
is calculated after the increment occurs. So the statement</p>

<pre><code>a = 3; <font class="CFunction">printf</font>(<font class="Quote">"a=%d a+1=%d\n"</font>, a, a++);
</code></pre><br/>

<p>would display "a=3 a+1=3</font>" but would finish
with a set to 4.
The decrement operator "--</font>" is used in the
same fashion as the increment operator.</p>

<h2>Control Flow</h2>

<p>KISS-C supports all of the standard C control structures.</p>

<!--Statements_and_Blocks-->

<a name="Statements_and_Blocks"></a>
<h2>Statements and Blocks</h2>

<p>A single C statement is ended by a semicolon. A series of statements
may be grouped
together into a block using curly braces. Inside a block, local
variables may be defined. Blocks may be
used in place of statements in the control flow constructs.</p>

<!--If-Else-->

<a name="If-Else"></a>
<h3>If-Else</h3>

<p>The <font class="CVariable">if else</font> statement is
used to make decisions. The syntax is:</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">if</font> (&lt;expression</font>&gt;)
    &lt;statement-1</font>&gt;
<font class="CVariable">else</font>
    &lt;statement-2</font>&gt;
</code></pre><br/>

<p>&lt;expression&gt; is evaluated; if it is not equal to zero
(e.g., logic true), then
&lt;statement-1&gt; is executed.</p>

<p>The <font class="CVariable">else</font> clause is
optional. If the
<font class="CVariable">if</font> part of the statement did
not execute, and the
<font class="CVariable">else</font> is present, then &lt;statement-2&gt;
executes.</p>

<!--While-->

<a name="While"></a>
<h3>While</h3>

<p>The syntax of a <font class="CVariable">while</font> loop
is the following:</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">while</font> (&lt;expression</font>&gt;)
    &lt;statement</font>&gt;
</code></pre><br/>

<p><font class="CVariable">while</font> begins by evaluating &lt;expression&gt;.
If it is false, then
&lt;statement&gt; is skipped. If it
is true, then &lt;statement&gt; is evaluated. Then the
expression is evaluated again, and the
same check is performed. The loop exits when &lt;expression&gt;
becomes zero.</p>

<p>One can easily create an infinite loop in C using the <font
face="Courier" class="CVariable">while</font> statement:</p>
 
<pre><code><font class="CVariable">while</font> (1)
    &lt;statement</font>&gt;
</code></pre><br/>

<!--Do-While-->

<a name="Do-While"></a>
<h3>Do-While</h3>
<p>The syntax of a <font class="CVariable">do</font>-<font class="CVariable">while</font> loop
is the following:</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">do</font>
    &lt;statement</font>&gt;
<font class="CVariable">while</font> (&lt;expression</font>&gt;);
</code></pre><br/>

<p>The equivalent <font class="CVariable">while</font> loop would be the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;statement</font>&gt;
<font class="CVariable">while</font> (&lt;expression</font>&gt;)
    &lt;statement</font>&gt;
</code></pre><br/>

<!--For-->
<a name="For"></a>
<h3>For</h3>

<p>The syntax of a <font class="CVariable">for</font> loop
is the following:</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">for</font> (&lt;expr-1</font>&gt;;&lt;expr-2</font>&gt;;&lt;expr-3</font>&gt;)
    &lt;statement</font>&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <font class="CVariable">for</font> construct is
equivalent to
the following construct using <font class="CVariable">while</font>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;expr-1</font>&gt;;
<font class="CVariable">while</font> (&lt;expr-2</font>&gt;)
{
    &lt;statement</font>&gt;
    &lt;expr-3</font>&gt;;
}</code></pre><br/>

<p>Typically, &lt;expr-1&gt; is an assignment, &lt;expr-2&gt;
is a relational expression, and &lt;expr-3&gt;
is an increment or decrement of some manner. For example, the following
code counts
from 0 to 99, printing each number along the way:</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">int</font> i;
<font class="CVariable">for</font> (i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)
    <font class="CFunction">printf</font>("%d\n", i);
</code></pre><br/>

<!--Switch-->

<a name="Switch"></a>
<h3>Switch</h3>

<p>The syntax of a <font class="CVariable">switch</font> block is as follows:</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">switch</font> (<font class="CVariable">int</font>)
{
    <font class="CVariable">case</font> const1</font>:
        &lt;statement list1</font>&gt;
    <font class="CVariable">break</font>;
    <font class="CVariable">case</font> const2</font>:
        &lt;statement list2</font>&gt;
    <font class="CVariable">break</font>;
    <font class="CVariable">default</font>:
        &lt;statement list3</font>&gt;
}</code></pre><br/>

<p>The <font class="CVariable">switch</font> construct takes an integer variable as input, and compares it to each 
<font class="CVariable">case</font> listed.  The first matching <font color="Times">const</font> is selected, and
execution begins there.  The <font class="CVariable">break</font> is optional, and if no break is found then execution
continues through each following statement.  Also note that each <font class="CVariable">case</font> has a 
list of single statements, as opposed to a block enclosed in curly braces.</p>

<p>Here's an example of how a <font class="CVariable">switch</font> might be used:</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">int</font> i = 1;
<font class="CVariable">switch</font>(i)
{

<!--Break-->

<a name="Break"></a>
<h3>Break</h3>

<p>Use of the <font class="CVariable">break</font> statement
provides an early exit from a
<font class="CVariable">while</font>, <font class="CVariable">do</font>-<font class="CVariable">while</font> or 
<font class="CVariable">for</font> loop.  The break statement can also provide an exit from a 
<font class="CVariable">switch</font> block.</p>

<!--LCD_Screen_Printing-->

<a name="LCD_Screen_Printing"></a>
<h2>LCD Screen Printing</h2>

<p>KISS-C has a version of the C function 
<font class="CFunction">printf</font> for formatted printing to the LCD screen.
KISS-C Also has a CBC specific print</font> command, <font class="CFunction">cbc_printf</font>, 
that allows limited cursor control.</p>

<p>The syntax of <font class="CFunction">printf</font> is the following:</p>

<pre><code><font class="CFunction">printf</font>(&lt;format-string</font>&gt;, &lt;arg-1</font>&gt; , ... , &lt;arg-N</font>&gt;);
</code></pre><br/>

This is best illustrated by some examples.

<h3>Printing Examples</h3>

<!--Printing_a_message-->

<div class="indent">

<a name="Printing_a_message"></a>
<h4>Example 1: Printing a message</h4>

<p>The following statement prints a text string to the screen.</p>

<pre><code><font class="CFunction">printf</font>(<font class="Quote">"Hello, world!\n"</font>);</code></pre><br/>

<p>In this example, the format string is simply printed to the screen.
The character <b>\n</b></font> at the end of the
string signifies end-of-line. When an end-of-line
character is printed, the LCD screen will be cleared when a subsequent
character is printed. Thus, most <font class="CFunction">printf</font>
statements are terminated by a
<b>\n</b></font>.</p>

<!--Printing_a_number-->

<a name="Printing_a_number"></a>
<h4>Example 2: Printing a number</h4>

<p>The following statement prints the value of the integer variable x
with a brief message.</p>

<pre><code><font class="CFunction">printf</font>(<font class="Quote">"Value is %d\n"</font>, x);</code></pre><br/>

<p>The special form <b>%d</b></font> is used to
format the printing of an integer in decimal format.</p>

<!--Printing_a_number_in_binary-->

<a name="Printing_a_number_in_binary"></a>
<h4>Example 3: Printing a number in binary</h4>

<p>The following statement prints the value of the integer variable x
as a binary number.</p>

<pre><code><font class="CFunction">printf</font>(<font class="Quote">"Value is %b\n"</font>, x);</code></pre><br/>

<p>The special form <b>%b</b></font> is used to
format the printing of an integer in binary format. Only the
low byte of the number is printed.</p>

<!--Printing_a_floating_point_number-->

<a name="Printing_a_floating_point_number"></a>
<h4>Example 4: Printing a floating point number</h4>

<p>The following statement prints the value of the floating point
variable n</font> as a floating
point number.</p>

<pre><code><font class="CFunction">printf</font>(<font class="Quote">"Value is %f\n"</font>, n);</code></pre><br/>

<p>The special form <b>%f</b></font> is used to
format the printing of floating point number.</p>

<!--Printing_two_numbers_in_hexadecimal_format-->

<a name="Printing_two_numbers_in_hexadecimal_format"></a>
<h4>Example 5: Printing two numbers in hexadecimal format</h4>

<pre><code><font class="CFunction">printf</font>(<font class="Quote">"A=%x  B=%x\n"</font>, a, b);</code></pre><br/>

<p>The form <b>%x</b></font> formats an integer to
print in hexadecimal.</p>

<!--Printing_using_cbc_printf-->

<a name="Printing_using_cbc_printf"></a>
<h4>Example 6: Printing using cbc_printf</h4>

<pre><code><font class="CFunction">cbc_printf</font>(0,2,<font class="Quote">"A=%d  B=%d"</font>, a, b);</code></pre><br/>

<p>The function <font class="CFunction"><b>cbc_printf</b></font> is like the statndard <font class="CFunction"><b>printf</b></font> 
function except the first two arguments specify the column and row (zero indexed) to start printing.  Note that 
<font class="CFunction"><b>cbc_printf</b></font> will not wrap, it will truncate
strings that go beyond the end of the line.</p>

<!--Preprocessor-->

<a name="Preprocessor"></a>
<h2>Preprocessor</h2>

<p>The preprocessor processes a file before it is sent to the compiler.
The KISS-C preprocessor
allows definition of macros, and conditional compilation of sections of
code. Using
preprocessor macros for constants and function macros can make KISS-C code
more efficient
as well as easier to read. Using <font class="CVariable">#if</font>
to conditionally compile code can be very useful, for
instance, for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>The special preprocessor command <font class="CVariable">#include</font>
has been included to allow programs to cause a
program to download to initiate the download of stored programs that
are not in the KISS-C
library. For example, suppose you have a set of stored programs in a
file named
"mylib.ic</font>", some of which you need for your
current program to work.</p>

<pre><code><font class="Comment">/* load my library */</font>
<font class="CVariable">#include</font> <font class="Quote">"mylib.ic"</font>

<font class="CVariable">void</font> main()
{
    <font class="CVariable">char</font> s[32] = <font class="Quote">"text string wrapping badly\n"</font>;
    fix(s);<font class="Comment">/* apply my fix function to s and print it */</font>
    <font class="CFunction">printf</font>(s);
}</code></pre><br/>

<!--Preprocessor_Macros-->

<a name="Preprocessor_Macros"></a>
<h3>Preprocessor Macros</h3>

<p>Preprocessor macros are defined by using the <font class="CVariable">#define</font> 
preprocessor directive at the start of a line. A macro is local to the file in which 
it is defined. The following example shows how to define preprocessor macros.</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">#define</font> RIGHT_MOTOR 0
<font class="CVariable">#define</font> LEFT_MOTOR  1
<font class="CVariable">#define</font> GO_RIGHT(power) (<font class="CFunction">motor</font>(RIGHT_MOTOR,(power)))
<font class="CVariable">#define</font> GO_LEFT(power)  (<font class="CFunction">motor</font>(LEFT_MOTOR,(power)))
<font class="CVariable">#define</font> GO(left,right) {GO_LEFT(left); GO_RIGHT(right);}
<font class="CVariable">void</font> main()
{
    GO(0,0);
}</code></pre><br/>

<p>Preprocessor macro definitions start with the <font class="CVariable">#define</font> 
directive at the start of a line, and continue to the end of the line. After 
<font class="CVariable">#define</font> is the name of the macro, such as
<b>RIGHT_MOTOR</b>. If there is a parenthesis directly after the name
of the macro, such as the <b>GO_RIGHT</b> macro has above, then the macro has arguments. 
The <b>GO_RIGHT</b> and <b>GO_LEFT</b> macros each take one argument. The GO macro takes two
arguments. After the name and the optional argument list is the body of the macro.</p>

<p>Each time a macro is invoked, it is replaced with its body. If the
macro has arguments,
then each place the argument appears in the body is replaced with the
actual argument
provided.</p>

<p>Invocations of macros without arguments look like global variable
references.
Invocations of macros with arguments look like calls to functions. To
an extent, this is
how they act. However, macro replacement happens before compilation,
whereas global
references and function calls happen at run time. Also, function calls
evaluate their
arguments before they are called, whereas macros simply perform text
replacement. For
example, if the actual argument given to a macro contains a function
call, and the macro
instantiates its argument more than once in its body, then the function
would be called
multiple times, whereas it would only be called once if it were being
passed as a function
argument instead.</p>

<p>Appropriate use of macros can make KISS-C programs and easier to read.
It allows constants
to be given symbolic names without requiring storage and access time as
a global would.
It also allows macros with arguments to be used in cases when a
function call is desirable
for abstraction, without the performance penalty of calling a function.</p>

<!--Conditional_compilation-->

<a name="Conditional_compilation"></a>
<h3>Conditional compilation</h3>

<p>It is sometimes desirable to conditionally compile code. The primary
example of this is
that you may want to perform debugging output sometimes, and disable it
at other times.
The KISS-C preprocessor provides a convenient way of doing this by using
the <font class="CVariable">#ifdef</font>
directive.</p>

<pre><code><font class="CVariable">void</font> go_left(<font class="CVariable">int</font> power)
{
    GO_LEFT(power);
    <font class="CVariable">#ifdef</font> DEBUG
    <font class="CFunction">printf</font>(<font class="Quote">"Going Left\n"</font>);
    <font class="CFunction">beep</font>();
    <font class="CVariable">#endif</font>
}</code></pre><br/>

<p>In this example, when the macro <b>DEBUG</b> is defined, the debugging
message "Going Left"
will be printed and the board will beep each time <b>go_left</b> is
called. If the macro is not
defined, the message and beep will not happen. Each 
<font class="CVariable">#ifdef</font> must be follwed by an
<font class="CVariable">#endif</font> at the end of the code
which is being conditionally compiled. The macro to be
checked can be anything, and <font class="CVariable">#ifdef</font>
blocks may be nested.</p>

<p>Unlike regular C preprocessors, macros cannot be conditionally
defined. If a macro
definition occurs inside an <font class="CVariable">#ifdef</font>
block, it will be defined regardless of whether the
<font class="CVariable">#ifdef</font> evaluates to true or
false. The compiler will generate a warning if macro
definitions occur within an <font class="CVariable">#ifdef</font>
block.</p>

<p>The <font class="CVariable">#if</font>, <font class="CVariable">#else</font>, and 
<font class="CVariable">#elif</font> directives are also available, but are
outside the scope of
this document. Refer to a C reference manual for how to use them.</p>

<!--The_CBC_Library_File-->

<a name="The_CBC_Library_File"></a>
<h2>The CBC Library File</h2>

<p>Library files provide standard C functions for interfacing with
hardware on the robot
controller board. These functions are written either in C or as
assembly language drivers.
Library files provide functions to do things like control motors, make
tones, and input
sensors values.</p>

<p>KISS-C automatically loads the library file every time it is invoked.</p>

<p>For convenience, a description of some of the more commonly used
library functions follows.</p>

This function is used to adjust the weights of the PID control for the motors. The p, i and d parameters are the numerators for the p, i and d coefficients.  The pd, id and dd parameters are their respective denominators.  Thus all of the parameters are integers, but the actual coefficients can be floats.  If a motor is jerky, the p and d terms should be reduced in size.  If a motor lags far behind, they should be increased. The default values are 30,0,-30,70,1,51.</font>

<h3>Create Library Functions</h3>

<p>The Create library is automatically loaded 
whenever CBC is chosen as the target. The functions which update 
sensor data, and the connection functions all return 0 if they are successful 
and return a negative number if there is some error. The functions update 
global variables all of which start with the prefic gc_. The movment function, 
with the exception of the script and block functions are all non-blocking. 
The movements will continue until a different movment command is given. 
The script commands will execute without blocking and will finish when 
the goal is reached. The blocking spin function will not return until 
the goal has been reached.</p>

<h3>Processes</h3>

<p>Processes work in parallel. Each process, once it is started, will
continue until it finishes
or until it is killed by another process using the 
<font class="CFunction">kill_process</font>(&lt;process_id)&gt;);
statement. Each process that is active gets a small amount of time.
Then the process is
paused temporarily and the next process gets its share of time. This
continues until all
the active process have gotten a slice of time, then it all repeats
again. From the user's
standpoint it appears that all the active processes are running in
parallel.</p>

<p>Processes can communicate with one another by reading and modifying
global variables.
The globals can be used as semaphores so that one process can signal
another. Process
IDs may also be stored in globals so that one process can kill another
when needed.</p>

<p>The library functions for controlling processes are:</p>

<pre><code><a name="start_processx"></a><font class="CFunction">start_process</font>(&lt;function_name</font>&gt;);
    <font class="Comment">/* start_process returns an integer that is the &lt;process_id&gt;
       and starts the function &lt;function_name&gt; as a separate
       process */</font>
       
<a name="deferx"></a><font class="CFunction">defer</font>();
    <font class="Comment">/* when placed in a function that is used as a process this
       will cause that process to give up the remainder of its time
       slice whenever defer is called */</font>

<ul>
  <li>Digital sensor</li>
  <li>Connect to ports 8-15</li>
  <li>Access with function <font class="CFunction"><a href="#digital">digital</a></font>(&lt;port#&gt;) </li>
  <li>1 indicates slot is empty</li>

  <li>These can be used much like touch sensors (if the object being
    touched fits in the slot);</li>
  <li>Special abilities when used as encoders - 
    This can be useful for the slot sensor in conjunction
    with a wheel, which allows measuring rotational rate and total angle.</li>
